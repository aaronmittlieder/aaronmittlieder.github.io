      <description>In the history of the National Football League (MVP), quarterbacks have generally been the most followed player on each team. These pass throwers also have won the Most Valuable Player awards more than any other position on the football field. The reason for that is because they are considered the field general on offense, and a team’s offensive success starts when the ball is snapped to the quarterback. With the amount of quarterbacks to win the most prestigious award in the league, it made me wonder which one got away with the honor with the “least best” statistics.</description>
